# 20/21 Economics 1 Feedbacks Analysis

By using bootstrapping method to do statistical analysis on the 57 responses we have received for our ECON1 Course Feedback Questionnaire, I got the below estimation of the overall Econ1 students' experience.

At a 75% confidence level, among the current Economics 1 students (20/21 academic year), 11-21% of them feel their experience at School of Economics is better than other schools, and 75-84% of them feel their experience at School of Economics is not worse than other schools. Comparing with other courses, 6-16% of students feel their experience in Economics 1 is better, and 72-84% feel it is not worse. The proportion of current students who feel who feel their Economics 1 tutorial experience is better compared with other courses is between 14% and 25%, and the proportion of them who feel their it is not worse compared with other courses' tutorials is roughly between 79% and 90%. Students' feedback on their experience to the School and to Economics 1 seem to be at a very similar level, their feedback on Econ1 tutorial experience is more positive when comparing with other courses.

As for their ratings to teachings in Semester 1 and 2 on a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest, we are 75% confident to say that 54-68% of the students rate Semester 1 teaching a 4 or above, and 49-63% of students rate Semester 2 teaching a 4 or above. Both results are pretty positive-looking.
